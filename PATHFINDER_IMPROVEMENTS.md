# Mineflayer-Pathfinder Improvements

## Jump-Up Movement Fix

**File**: `node_modules/mineflayer-pathfinder/lib/movements.js`
**Function**: `getMoveJumpUp` (line ~301)

### Problem
The pathfinder would attempt to jump even when there was no physical block to land on, causing the bot to hop uselessly in place.

### Solution
Added an early check to skip jump attempts when there's no landing surface available:

```javascript
// Early check: if there's no physical block to land on and we can't place blocks, don't try this move
const blockD = this.getBlock(node, dir.x, -1, dir.z)
if (!blockC.physical && !blockD.physical && node.remainingBlocks === 0) return
```

This check should be added at line ~315, right after the entity intersection checks and before the main `if (!blockC.physical)` block.

### Impact
- Reduces unnecessary jumping when pathfinding is stuck
- Bot fails faster when movement is impossible
- Less CPU waste on impossible path calculations

### Note
This change is in node_modules and won't persist after `npm install`. Consider:
1. Forking mineflayer-pathfinder and submitting a PR
2. Using patch-package to persist this change
3. Maintaining this as a local modification
