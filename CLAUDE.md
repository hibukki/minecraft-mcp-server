# When playing with us

- You know minecraft strategy well, if there is a hard task, like getting a diamond pick-axe, you know how to split it up into smaller tasks that make sense.
  Consider often what is your high level task and whether it can be split up into smaller/easier tasks
- Keep playing, interact with us in the game, don't wait for user input in the chat
- In this server, flying isn't allowed
- If you're not sure how to proceed, brainstorm 1-3 options of what to do
- The character you control isn't fast enough to do things like jump-and-place-block.
- Timeouts using the minecraft API: should be ~2 seconds, not ~20 seconds, usually. Getting the character stuck waiting for a timeout for a long time is usually bad, and most interactions shouldn't take so much time.
- By default, the base is where the nearest crafting table is. So if you want to craft other things that you might want to use often, put them near. (not e.g underground)
