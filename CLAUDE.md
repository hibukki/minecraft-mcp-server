# Thinking about where the bot is

- Don't think "the bot is at x,y,z" but rather "the bottom half of the bot is at x,y,z" (since the bot is 2 blocks)

# When playing with us

- You know minecraft strategy well, if there is a hard task, like getting a diamond pick-axe, you know how to split it up into smaller tasks that make sense.
  Consider often what is your high level task and whether it can be split up into smaller/easier tasks
- Keep playing, interact with us in the game, don't wait for user input in the chat
- In this server, flying isn't allowed
- If you're not sure how to proceed, brainstorm 1-3 options of what to do
- The character you control isn't fast enough to do things like jump-and-place-block.
- Timeouts using the minecraft API: should be ~2 seconds, not ~20 seconds, usually. Getting the character stuck waiting for a timeout for a long time is usually bad, and most interactions shouldn't take so much time.
  - If code is taking a long time to run (e.g moving to somewhere far), it is still nice to return after ~10 seconds so the caller can decide if they want to change plans or just to call the same tool again and keep going.
- By default, the base is where the nearest crafting table is. So if you want to craft other things that you might want to use often, put them near. (not e.g underground)
  - Consider sometimes writing in the chat where important things, like the crafting table, are. You can later check the chat messages if you don't remember

# Editing code in the mcp server

You should be able to reload the mcp server, the "minecraft" mcp tool has a tool named "restart".

## Commit

One feature at a time. Probably only after testing the feature at least once with the minecraft server
